Name one or two features you’d like to implement:  I would like to implement two different colors for the X and O square button components. I also think that the winner's message and the next player's color should be in the same color as the button color. Finally, I have implemented a new game button called 'New Game' to refresh or reload the game during and upon completion of the game. 

How would you implement those features? For the first feature, I created 2 classes for the background color of the buttons in HTML style tag with the 'orange' and 'black' In JSX file, I defined the class name within the button tag with conditional logic via ternary operator.                      Also, for the second feature, I created two classes for the font color in HTML style tag with the name 'fontOrange and fontBlack'. In JSX file, I defined the class name within the H1 tag with conditional logic via ternary operator for both the winner's message and the next player's color.
